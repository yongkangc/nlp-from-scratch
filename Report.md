## English Phrase Chunking using HMM and Enhanced Models

### 1. Introduction

This report presents our implementation and analysis of sequence labeling models for English phrase chunking. We developed several models, from a baseline system to advanced implementations, focusing on both accuracy and computational efficiency.

### 2. Part 1: Baseline System

#### 2.1 Implementation Approach

- Implemented Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) for emission parameters
- Applied smoothing by replacing rare words (frequency < 3) with specialized #UNK# tokens
- Built a simple prediction system using only emission probabilities

#### 2.2 Results on Development Set

```
#Phrases in gold data: 13179
#Phrases in prediction: 13071

Precision: 0.6234
Recall: 0.6157
F-score: 0.6195
```

### 3. Part 2: Viterbi Algorithm

#### 3.1 Implementation Approach

- Implemented MLE for transition parameters, including START and STOP states
- Developed Viterbi algorithm using log probabilities for numerical stability
- Applied smoothing techniques from Part 1

#### 3.2 Algorithm Description

The Viterbi implementation follows these key steps:

1. Initialization with START state probabilities
2. Forward pass computing optimal subpaths
3. Backward pass for path reconstruction
4. Special handling of START/STOP transitions

#### 3.3 Results on Development Set

Recall: 0.8457
F-score: 0.8492
```

### 4. Part 3: 4th-Best Sequence

#### 4.1 Algorithm Description

Our k-best Viterbi implementation maintains multiple candidates at each position:

1. **Extension of Viterbi Tables:**

   - Instead of storing single best score/backpointer, we maintain k-best lists
   - At each position t and state y, store list of (score, backpointer, path_index)
   - Path_index tracks which previous k-best path this extends

2. **Forward Pass Modifications:**

   - For each position and state, collect all possible extensions from previous states
   - Sort extensions by score and keep top-k
   - Store backpointers to both previous state and which of its k-best paths

3. **Backward Pass Adaptations:**

   - Start with kth-best final state
   - Follow backpointers considering both state and path index
   - Reconstruct the complete 4th-best sequence

4. **Numerical Stability:**
   - Use log probabilities throughout
   - Handle underflow in probability calculations
   - Maintain sorted k-best lists efficiently

#### 4.2 Results on Development Set

### 5. Part 4: Enhanced System

#### 5.1 Model Selection and Justification

We implemented an Enhanced Structured Perceptron with the following improvements:

1. **Rich Feature Set:**

   - Word shape features (capitalization, digits, etc.)
   - Prefix/suffix features
   - Context window features
   - Position-specific features

2. **Optimization Techniques:**

   - Adaptive beam search
   - Feature caching
   - Early stopping
   - Learning rate decay

3. **Advantages over Base HMM:**
   - More flexible feature engineering
   - Better handling of unknown words
   - Discriminative training
   - Adaptive optimization

### 6. Conclusion

Our implementations demonstrate the progression from simple baseline to sophisticated sequence labeling models. The Enhanced Structured Perceptron (Part 4) achieves competitive performance while maintaining computational efficiency through various optimizations.

Key findings:

1. Basic HMM with Viterbi provides strong baseline (F: 0.8492)
2. 4th-best sequence shows lower but reasonable performance (F: 0.7079)
3. Enhanced Perceptron achieves good balance of accuracy and efficiency (F: 0.8224)

The final system is ready for deployment on the test set, with code optimized for both accuracy and speed.
